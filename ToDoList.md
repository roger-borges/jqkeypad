# List of Future Plans for jqKeyPad #

  * KeyPad popup support for use in kiosks
  * JQuery UI theme-roller integration
  * Support long presses that show different keys, like how mobile phones pop-up accent versions of a character
  * Disable text selection so keyboard doesn't get highlighted on fast clicks.
  * Create an option to create the entire keyboard from the intializer. Ie. allow the user to specify which keys to use without creating the HTML.
